http://msi/ReportServer_LANCE_SQLSERVER (set this as url inside SSDT)
http://msi/Reports_LANCE_SQLSERVER (graphical UI where you can configure your reporting server - i.e., user access - note that you cannot set this as the url in SSDT projects & use the Report)

to grant regular user access, navigate to reporting url (in my case: http://msi/Reports_LANCE_SQLSERVER) and set permissions at site and folder level to your user (just the username, without prefix... for me, 'lfallo1' and NOT 'msi/lfallo1'

custom login for sql server reporting tools that I set inside the sql server reporting tools configuration manager
username: MSI/lfallo1
password: $noopy3431
